# Bash Scripting and System Administration Project

## Overview
A hands-on project that applies bash scripting and system administration to configure a networked environment with server and client machines. It includes server setup, client configuration, and deployment of a basic web server, emphasizing automation and security.

## Key Learnings
- Bash scripting for automation of server and client configurations.
- System administration tasks including user management, SSH/SFTP setup, and web server deployment.
- Network security and protocol configurations.

## Getting Started
- Set up three VMs as described in the project instructions.
- Use Fedora.
- Ensure that all devices are connected to a single mobile hotspot, and that the `bridged network` option is enabled instead of `NAT`.
- Use `serversetup.sh` for server configurations and `clientsetup.sh` for client machine preparations.
- `welcome.html` is deployed to demonstrate web server functionality.

## Usage
Execute the bash scripts on the respective machines to automate the setup process. Ensure that `serversetup.sh` is run first. Detailed guidelines about the project are provided in `Project1.pdf`.
